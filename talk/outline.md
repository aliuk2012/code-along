# Live coding across all the things

> We'll look at building a browser-based script editor, covering some useful things like code transpilation, module loading, tree shaking & infinite loop detection. Then we'll distribute our code changes to create a multi-device, multi-user, web-based, super-fun development environment.

* Hello!
* part 1 - editing in browser
* The problem statement
* The basic solution elements
* Populating a window
  * data-uri
    * btoa
  * blob urls
  * frame.contentWindow.append?
  * service worker
* Making it feel like more of a text editor {{We expect things to look better}}
  * plugins:
    * ace editor
    * CodeMirror
    * Monaco
  * content-editable?
* Transforming JS {{Do we even write javascript anymore}}
  * build tools & transform
  * Babel
  * Bubl√©
    * difference from babel
    * unsupported features
  * using this in our example - buble.transform(d).code
* Other files
  * generally we don't have a single isolated js script
  * browserify, webpack, requirejs, sprokets, brocolli, grunt, gulp, brunch
  * Rollup.js
    * difference from other stuff
    * es2016
    * d3.js, three.js
  * using this in our example rollup.rollup
* Loop detection
  * problem - unresponsive scripts
  * loop-protect, how this works



* part 2 - across all the things



```
for(var i = 0; i < 100; i--){
  console.log("whoop whoop")
}

{;loopProtect.protect({ line: 1, reset: true });
for(var i = 0; i < 100; i--){;
  if (loopProtect.protect({ line: 1 })) break;

  console.log("whoop whoop")
}}
```
